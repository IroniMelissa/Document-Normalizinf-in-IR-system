## Steps of Document normalizing in Information Retrieval systems.
 1. Tokenization
 2. Stop words
 3. Normalization to Terms

 - In Lab2.1 file we use python code to do split sentences into tokens.
 
  - In Lab2.2 file we use NLTK platform.
  NLTK is a platform which support to build Python programs to work with human language data. 
   It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for      
   classification,tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries.
